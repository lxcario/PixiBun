# Build Plan — PixiBun

## Phase 14 — 2.5D Photometric Studio, Normal Mapping, Geometry Engine & Mathematical Dithering Suite
**Goal:** Deliver a mathematically rigorous computer graphics and pixel intelligence suite built into the PixiBud inspector and canvas engine: linear-time $O(N)$ Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT), analytical tangent-space normal vector fields with standard blue texture baking $(128, 128, 255)$, Blinn-Phong specular half-vector glints, discrete Laplace cavity ambient occlusion, 5 physical material presets, OKLab perceptual color quantization, and recursive Bayer matrix dither modulation.

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Linear-Time $O(N)$ Separable Euclidean Distance Transform (Felzenszwalb-Huttenlocher algorithm).
- [x] Non-linear height dome inflation ($\gamma = 0.5$) with edge-preserving Bilateral filtering.
- [x] Discrete Sobel partial derivative kernels ($K_x, K_y$) and analytical unit normal vector derivation.
- [x] 1-Click Tangent Normal Map Baker writing standard $(128, 128, 255)$ normal maps directly to a new Layer for game engines (Godot, Unity, Unreal).
- [x] Discrete Laplace operator for Cavity Map / Ambient Occlusion (AO) in surface crevices.
- [x] Full Photometric Lighting equation with Lambert diffuse, Blinn-Phong specular, cavity AO, and inverse square distance attenuation.
- [x] 5 Material Presets: *Matte Clay*, *Polished Metal*, *Glossy Glass*, *Velvet Fabric*, *Gold / Brass*.
- [x] OKLab Perceptual Color Matching ($\Delta E_{\text{OKLab}}$) and recursive Bayer matrix dither offset modulation.
- [x] Rational Bézier curves, Wu's quantized 2:1 isometric lines, RotSprite 8x rotation, and Zhang-Suen 1px skeleton thinning.
- [x] Contextual Tool Options Strip (30px high dynamic toolbar beneath header) and categorized artisan Left Toolbar.
- [x] Live Viewport Normal Map Preview inspection toggle.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Type-check (`tsc --noEmit`), build (`next build`), and tests pass with 0 errors.
- Normal maps bake cleanly to distinct layers with $(128, 128, 255)$ baseline flat normals.
- Photometric lighting applies physically accurate specular glints, diffuse shading, and clean OKLab Bayer dithering.

## Phase 13 — Lamplit Identity: De-Slop, Cozy Studio & Hero Landing Page
**Goal:** Replace generic tool-panel feel with an authored identity per FullStackGuide: one signature element (the lamplit desk), a hand-pixelled brand mark, warm human copy everywhere, and a hero landing page that lets visitors draw before they enter.

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Token overhaul: desk/wood-grain surfaces, lamp amber accents, static CSS dither textures, scroll unlocked globally.
- [x] Route restructure: landing at `/`, editor moved to `/studio` with its own metadata; autosave hydration verified through the move.
- [x] Signature element shipped once per scene: `.lamp-pool` overlay on viewport and hero; canvas frame reads as paper under lamp light.
- [x] Bun mascot (`src/components/ui/BunMascot.tsx`): hand-plotted 16x16 SVG, idle/blink/happy poses, reduced-motion-safe blink; header brand plate rebuilt around it.
- [x] Copy de-slop: all eleven inspector feedback strings rewritten emoji-free in craftsperson voice; "1-Click Magic" replaced.
- [x] Landing page: hero + interactive 32x20 DoodlePad, narrative feature story (no bento grid), starter sprite gallery rendered via `paintTemplate`, quiet footer.
- [x] Starter art system: `src/types/landing.ts`, `src/lib/art/starterTemplates.ts` (four hand-authored 16x16 sprites), `src/lib/render/templateRenderer.ts`.
- [x] WCAG focus restored: amber focus-visible rings on TactileButton, doodle swatches, CTAs.
- [x] Tests: `starterTemplates.test.ts`, `templateRenderer.test.ts` (suite now 24 tests).
- [x] DESIGN.md locked: signature element, expanded tokens, texture rules, landing voice guide with banned phrases.
